# Poke-n-Pork Game Guidelines

## Component Guidelines

* Keep the game mechanics focused on the core pork-poking gameplay
* Maintain the political theme while keeping it playful and satirical
* Preserve the audio system functionality for iPhone/iOS compatibility
* Use the existing pork types and agency data structures
* Keep the difficulty scaling system (levels 1-12) intact

## Technical Guidelines

* Some base components have styling (gap/typography) baked in as defaults
* Make sure to explicitly set any styling information from guidelines in the generated React to override the defaults
* Use the existing localStorage system for saving game progress
* Maintain the audio context handling for mobile device compatibility
